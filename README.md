# GitEase

GitEase is a desktop app (Qt/QML + C++) that will provide a complete, visual workflow for Git and popular hosts like GitHub and GitLab. It is aimed at day‑to‑day project control without touching the command line: clone and manage repositories, switch and merge branches, stage/commit/tag/stash, review history and diffs, and handle PR/MR and issues in one place.

## Run the app
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/GitEase
```
